## Executive Summary

Wiley University, founded in 1873, stands as one of the oldest Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) west of the Mississippi River. As we approach our sesquicentennial anniversary, this strategic plan establishes a framework for significantly expanding external funding through grants and foundation support. Our goal is to triple external funding from grants within five years, establishing Wiley as a competitive grant-seeking institution while maintaining our mission of providing quality education to underserved populations.
