## Grants Database Utilization Strategy
### Driving Sustainable Grant Acquisition
### Office of Institutional Advancement and Grants

## I. Executive Overview

The Wiley University Grants Database is more than a reference document—it is a strategic tool designed to drive systematic, sustainable grant acquisition. This strategy outlines how the database will be operationalized to transform grant-seeking from reactive, opportunistic pursuits into a proactive, data-driven enterprise that consistently produces results.

---

## II. Strategic Framework for Database Utilization

### A. The Pipeline Model

Grant acquisition should be viewed as a pipeline with multiple stages:

```
PROSPECT → CULTIVATE → PROPOSE → STEWARD → RENEW
    │           │           │          │         │
Identify    Build       Submit    Manage    Secure
Opportunities Relations  Proposals  Awards  Continuation
```

The database serves different functions at each stage:

| Stage | Database Function |
|-------|-------------------|
| Prospect | Identify aligned opportunities |
| Cultivate | Track funder interests, deadlines, contacts |
| Propose | Access requirements, past awards, success factors |
| Steward | Document reporting requirements, contacts |
| Renew | Track renewal cycles, new opportunities with existing funders |

### B. The Funnel Approach

To achieve target funding levels, maintain a consistent proposal pipeline:

**Year 3 Target: $2.5M in grants**
- Assuming 40% success rate by dollar value
- Required pipeline: $6.25M in proposals submitted
- At average $100K per proposal: ~62 proposals annually
- Monthly target: 5-6 proposals submitted

The database enables this volume by providing ready access to vetted opportunities.

## III. Operational Procedures for Database Use

---

## IV. Database-Driven Prospect Identification

### A. Opportunity Scoring Matrix

For each opportunity in the database, apply this scoring system:

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Mission Alignment | 25% | How well does this align with Wiley's mission? |
| Capacity Match | 25% | Do we have the staff/resources to execute? |
| Competitive Position | 20% | How competitive are we for this award? |
| Strategic Value | 15% | Does this advance institutional priorities? |
| Funding Amount | 10% | Is the award size worth the effort? |
| Relationship | 5% | Do we have existing funder relationships? |

**Score Interpretation:**
- 4.0-5.0: Priority pursuit—assign immediately
- 3.0-3.9: Strong prospect—schedule for development
- 2.0-2.9: Selective pursuit—pursue if capacity allows
- Below 2.0: Not recommended at this time

### B. Annual Pursuit List Development

Using the scoring matrix, develop an annual "Pursuit List" of 50-75 opportunities:

**Tier 1 (Must Submit - 15 opportunities):**
- Score 4.0+
- Core institutional support (Title III, UNCF)
- Recurring opportunities with strong track record

**Tier 2 (Priority Targets - 25 opportunities):**
- Score 3.5-3.9
- Strong alignment, reasonable competitiveness
- Mix of federal and foundation

**Tier 3 (Opportunity Pipeline - 20+ opportunities):**
- Score 3.0-3.4
- Develop as capacity allows
- Build toward future competitiveness

**Tier 4 (Watch List):**
- Below 3.0 but potentially valuable
- Monitor for changes in eligibility or capacity
